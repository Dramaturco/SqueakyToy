# Squeaky Toy

The object of this game is to put your kid to sleep and to avoid stepping on the squeaky toys.

To run you need to host the directory on any kind of webserver.
For example by running
`npx live-server .`
in the game's directory.

This project uses the phaserjs library to render game objects and sounds.
